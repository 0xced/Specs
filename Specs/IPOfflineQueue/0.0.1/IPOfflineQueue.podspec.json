  "description": "                    IPOfflineQueue is a persistent, serial task queue for iOS. It's especially ideal for queuing actions that require an internet connection that may be slow or absent.\n\n                    * You enqueue tasks to it, and they run whenever they can in a background thread.\n                    * Tasks are always executed in the order in which they were added (FIFO).\n                    * Tasks are __not__ executed in parallel, although you are free to run parallel operations in your task-execution handler.\n                    * Queued tasks persist between application launches.\n                    * The application will remain running in the background until the queue completes or until iOS kills it (after no more than 10 minutes).\n                    * You're welcome to operate multiple queue instances if you'd like to run different tasks.\n                    * GCD is used extensively to prevent blocking the main thread.\n",
